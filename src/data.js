    dreamforceProject: "I co-created an interactive game for customers to experience inaccessibility first hand. We had two computers: one with an accessible conference website, the other with an inaccessible version. The challenge was who could register the fastest for the conference. There were so many ‘ah-ha!’ moments when the inaccessible version prevented people from completing. Customers told us this was the most impactful experience at Dreamforce.",
